# Concentration-of-Measure-and-High-Dimensional-Statistical-learning
This is a presentation of the article "On the conditioning of random subdictionaries" by J. A. Tropp. Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal., vol. 25, pp. 1--24, 2008 which I did as part of the course Concentartion of Measure and High Dimensional Statistical Learning in the first semester of 2021 in the Advanced Mathematics M2 program at ENS de Lyon. The project was done in collaboration with Leo Davy.
